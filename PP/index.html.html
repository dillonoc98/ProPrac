                <p>Reflexology is a gentle, non-invasive therapy, which is based on the theory that all parts of the body are reflected in the feet.
Reflexology stimulates all the systems of the body, promoting optimum functioning, and balancing of the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual, aspects of the individual.  My training is in African reflexology, which works the same reflex points on the feet, as classical reflexology.  The added dimension of African Reflexology, as reported by clients, is that it seems to have a deeply relaxing affect, which soothes and brings balance of emotions – reducing stress, calming the mind and spirit, and it is in this balanced state, that most healing is possible.</p>

<p>Reflexology is suitable for all ages.  It has a deeply soothing affect on all systems especially the nervous, digestive and endocrine sytems,  It is helpful for a wide range of ailments including:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
    <li>Hormonal imbalance – PMS, menopause, hypothyroidism etc</li>
    <li>Digestive disorders  e.g. Chronns Disease/li>
    <li>Headaches, migraines</li>
    <li>Breathing problems including asthma</li>
    <li> Circulatory problems</li>
    <li>Sinusitis</li>
    <li>  Nervous system disorders</li>
    <li>Emotional upset</li>
    <li>Grief</li>
    <li>Recovering from trauma</li>
    <li> Back pain, sciatica</li>
    <li>Heart problems – physical and emotional</li>
    <li>To reduce the stress response in the body</li>
</ul>  

<h3>
A TYPICAL REFLEXOLOGY TREATMENT
</h3>
    <p>
To begin with I normally ask a few questions about the client’s general health, and well being, and medical history.
The client is then made comfortable on a plinth covered by a blanket and supported with pillows.
I cleanse the feet with a foot spray, and work with either tea tree powder or corn flour.  I stimulate reflex points on both feet, and work the body systems on the feet – normally taking about 50 mins. During this time most clients relax and sometimes sleep. </p>
                    <p>
At the end of the treatment I apply almond oil, with some blend of essential oils.
I always allow a few minutes for the client to recover themselves, and I may reflect some observations to the client, or suggest some possible healthy options for them.</p>
                    <p>
Some people come to just experience reflexology, but most people come for reflexology with the hope of alleviating some discomfort – physical or emotional.  Some people will come for 4 – 6 sessions, and when they have experienced some benefits of reflexology they may book monthly or 6 weekly treatments to support their well-being.  The decision to return is totally up to the individual. One of the benefits of reflexology is that it helps a person to become more self-aware, especially body aware, and they are more empowered in choosing when and how often they may benefit from reflexology.</p>

Polarity therapy is a gentle holistic therapy, applicable to many health problems, and is beneficial to maintaining good health.  It is a therapy that is based on the five elements – earth, water, fire, air and ether. These elemental energies exist everywhere in nature, and Polarity therapy asserts that the flow of and balance  of energy in the human body is the  foundation of good health. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
<p>
When elemental energy is unbalanced or blocked in the human body due to stress, pain and dis-ease arises for the individual.  This is a communication from the body that balancing of one, or more of  the energy lines in the body is required.  Polarity therapy seeks to find these blockages and release energy to allow normal flow of energy in the body, which facilitates the body’s return to health.  Polarity therapy is an energy-based bodywork, which can take diverse forms, but always holds the underlying intention to support that every individual holds an inherent self-healing intelligence within them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
<p>
My own experience of polarity therapy was so transformative, that it caused me to learn all I could about it, and eventually to become a polarity therapist.  In hindsight, polarity began a huge positive change in my life.  Physically it helped me to alleviate back pain and other physical ailments, emotionally it supported me through a process of personal grief, it reduced my stress response to very traumatic personal events in my life, and it strengthened my sense of my self, empowering me to make healthier choices in my life.  Though subtle, I feel polarity expanded my spiritual practise and made it easier to quieten my mind, and to meditate more deeply.  It has been one of the many gifts life presented to me, and I am most grateful for it. I feel doubly blessed, when I can now share this therapy to the benefit of others.
                    </p>
                    <br>
<p>
As a practitioner of Polarity Therapy I have observed amazing beneficial results for clients.  Physically  I have been witness to how polarity has  alleviated the pain and discomfort  of sciatica, polymyalgia, digestive disorders, migraine, insomnia, hormone imbalance, pms, etc.  Emotionally I have witnessed  Polarity alleviate stress and anxiety, and emotional upset.  It seems to particularly support clients through grief.  I often hear clients report that polarity seems to ‘shift’ their awareness inward, and they become more self aware.</p>

                    <h3>A TYPICAL POLARITY SESSION</h3>
                    <br>
    <p>
A typical session of polarity therapy is 60 mins.  The client remains clothed.  The session will begin with me asking a few questions about their general health, medical history, and lifestyle.  The client will then lie on a plinth, usually with a blanket and supported by pillows. </p>
                    <br>
<p>
During the session of polarity, I will make different contact points on the body, with some rocking and holding.  The client may be invited to use their breath to accelerate the release of tension or stuck energy. He/she may become aware of subtle energetic sensations, often experienced as tingling, heat, cold, wavelike movement, and or deep relaxation.</p>
                    <br>
<p>
I will always allow a few minutes of recovery time for the client.  I may reflect any feedback necessary to the client.   The results of Polarity therapy vary greatly, but most clients report feeling deeply relaxed, in an almost meditative state.  It can be hugely beneficial in alleviating physical pain or discomfort, and calming emotional upset.  Polarity therapy deepens a person’s sense of themselves, empowering them to make wiser, and healthier choices for their lives.</p>

                        <p>I have the pleasure of working in the beautiful rooms at Naduir Centre for holistic health and healing, Furbo, Galway.  I love working as a therapist, and working in Naduir, provides the most conducive environment for my therapy work, as it is nestled in the heart of beautiful natural country side. Naduir has a growing garden, a yoga studio and therapy rooms with many therapies for an individual to choose from. </p>

<br>
                        <p>

I trained as a nurse in London. Over the past 15 years I have completed many courses in holistic healing and health.  Some of these trainings include Swedish massage, Reiki, Indian Head Massage, Psychodynamic psychotherapy, Dream Analysis, Silva Method Meditaion, Louise Hay ‘You Can Heal Your Life’, African Reflexology, and Polarity therapy.</p>
<br>
                            <br>
I have always been drawn to the caring professions, from my background in nursing, to the deep psychological analysis of psychotherapy, and back to the body energy work of polarity therapy and reflexology.  I was lucky to have found polarity therapy 9 years ago, and I found  for me personally that regular treatments have really helped me to maintain, good health of body, mind, emotion, and spirit. I came upon reflexology as a therapy to help me with symptoms of sinusitis, and I have witnessed its benefits for clients with numerous, physical and emotional issues. I have focused most of my therapy work around reflexlogy of the feet and polarity therapy, and I feel most fulfilled in these therapies.</p>
